      citeRχiv helps researchers predict the potential impact of their papers before submission.
      By analyzing your title and abstract, it offers a quick forecast of citation count, impact factor, 
      and potential significance—so you can sharpen your message and aim higher.
    </p>
    <p class="tagline">
      This tool is a work in progress, built to explore the potential of language models in research forecasting. 
      Future versions will offer smarter predictions and integration with citation databases. Current predictions are random draws and are not real predictions at this time.
